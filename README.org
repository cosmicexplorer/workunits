#+TITLE: workunits
#+STARTUP: showall

A cross-language facility for [[subprocess tracing]] and [[output teeing]].

* output teeing [1/3]
- [-] establish a (parallelizable) centralized stream reader/writer interface: [1/2]
  - [X] named datatypes :: if the same type of output is being written, make it clear
  - [ ] recursive namespace prefixes :: namespaces imply lifetimes (?)
- [X] figure out how to store tee'd outputs during the run /minimize write latency/
- [ ] create a <<query language>> for tee'd outputs

* subprocess tracing [0/2]
- [ ] associate the write stream open/close events with timed "workunit" spans as RAII
- [ ] integrate spans with the [[https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing][~tracing~]] crate

* production readiness [0/2]
- [ ] testing [0/2]
  - [ ] add proptest
  - [ ] maybe other fuzz/generative testing /especially anything that tests parallel execution ordering/
- [ ] complete docs

* License
